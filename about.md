## My name is Ariel Silva and I'm from Brazil.

*But before I properly present myself, let me say something serious about me: I don't know how to samba. I know, that sux. But you have to get over it.*

*Feeling better? Great. Let's move on.*

What to say about me? That's a trick question. It's always hard to speak about yourself, right? So I'll keep this simple and short.

I'm a Web Developer learning **Nodejs** with **TDD**.

I'm deeply interested in Back-End programming, but that doesn't mean I'm not willing to roll up my sleeves and learn whatever I need to.
Being a programmer is about solving problems, not about the language.

Beside programming, I'm really interested in **Psychology** and how it can improve our lives as programmers. I'll write about how we can apply psychology principles to make our coding lives easier.

And since I'm quite new in this web developer thing, it's still fresh in my mind how a noob thinks. So if you are a newby in programming, don't you worry, you'll feel welcome here.

To sum up, if you are interested in any of the subjects bellow, you should stick with me.
* Javascript
* Nodejs
* Test Driven Development
* Psychology applied to coding
* Having fun

And if you have any other question, don't be shy to [mail me](mailto:ariel.abreu.silva@gmail.com)
