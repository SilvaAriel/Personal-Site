What if you were more emotional than you realized?

Was there a day when you felt like you could do anything? You felt ready to solve any problem, to learn any programming language, and to kill any [bug]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-07-18-dont_nuke_bug %}). There was no fear and nothing could stop you. But then, the next day, you felt like everything was overwhelming. Just the thought of solving a problem would crush you.

I felt like that several times.

What happened to us? Well, we were caught by discouragement boogeyman.

<span style="color:gray">(sometimes it feel like a monster)</span>

Do you know how much of our decisions are guided by our feelings? According to the <a href="https://bigthink.com/experts-corner/decisions-are-emotional-not-logical-the-neuroscience-behind-decision-making">neuroscientist Antonio Damasio</a>, a lot. That's insane! Our feelings change all the time. 

So, since we can't help but be guided by my emotions, at least we can try to define what emotions we will feel.

## Changing the mindset

**Our mindset is our algorithm**. If we are getting the wrong output, we have to change the algorithm.

This is the most important step to beat the discouragement.

What's our usual mindset when it comes to motivation and action? It's something like this:
* I feel like coding now.
* I will code now.

That is, we feel like doing something and we use the feeling as an excuse or an incentive to do it.

That's not a good mindset for us programmers (or anybody) to have. A better mindset would be:
* I will code now.
* I will feel like coding now.

From now on, instead of waiting for the motivation to come, you can sit and decide what you want to achieve today. After that, you will know what kind of motivation you need to have.

## Reproducing the motivation

This step is easier. All you have to do now is note down the things that motivates you to code.

Let me give you an example of my motivators. As the time of writing this post, I have two:
* A Portugal's wallpaper with the text "Imagine you and Priscila (my wife) traveling to your new home in Portugal."
* A programmer's web page slightly older than me who has achieved a lot!

Whenever I look at the wallpaper I feel like my coding career and my trip to Portugal are closely related (which they are). And when I look at the programmer's page I remember that I can achieve a lot. All I have to do is being part of a community and finish my personal projects.

**So tell me, what motivates you?**

### Motivation loop

All this change will create a habit loop, so it might take a while to get used to it. Keep trying until it becomes a second nature.

Don't you ever give up!

See ya.
